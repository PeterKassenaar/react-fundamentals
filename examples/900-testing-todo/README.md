# Simple TODO application with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

See the source code for comments. There are basically two scripts:
- `npm run test` - runs the general Test command on `todo-api.spec.js`.
- `npm run test:component` - runs React Testing Library (RTL) to test component stuff and rendering.
- Remove the `.skip` code in the various files to run more tests. See comments inside the files.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

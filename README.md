The repo has an `examples` folder with all the code examples. They are numbered for your reference. A quick guide:
- 1xx - General components, props.
- 2xx - Working with data.
- 3xx - Styling components.
- 4xx - Working with form elements.
- 5xx - Working with API's

Every example is a small mini project. Perform an `npm install` for every folder you want to examine. This is not a monorepo.

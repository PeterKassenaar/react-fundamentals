Example code and exercises on the training React Fundamentals by Peter Kassenaar. Contact us for a training at your company or organization!

## Contents
The repo has an `examples` folder with all the code examples. They are numbered for your reference. A quick guide:
- 1xx - General components, props.
- 2xx - Working with data.
- 3xx - Styling components.
- 4xx - Working with form elements.
- 5xx - Working with API's
- 6xx - React Router

Every example is a small mini project. Perform an `npm install` for every folder/project you want to run. 
This is not a monorepo.

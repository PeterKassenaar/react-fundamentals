## Workshops
The folders and directories in this branch represent the 'solutions' to the workshops in the course.

Please bear in mind that there are often more ways to solve a specific problem and that the workshops absolutely do not represent *the only* let alone *the best* way to solve a problem.

Let me know if you think you found a better/more suitable solution.

Use git to checkout the workshops branch to see the solutions in your folder tree.

`git checkout workshops`

Or of course use your UI tool.
